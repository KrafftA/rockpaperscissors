# rockpaperscissors
This is a rock paper scissors game made following instructions from The Odin Project.
Play 5 rounds against the computer using the command line.
You will know the result of each round as well as the ending score after 5 rounds. 

I have not added CSS elements. This project exists for me to practice and test functions.
